# Hospital Management Portal

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hospital Management Portal project! This project is developed as a learning exercise in Bootstrap 5. The UI design is based on a Figma design for a Hospital Management Sample UI, which you can find [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Mky2jOZtcULhwtu5KPrdLR/Hospital-Management-Sample-UI-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4jKdAgJ0icC1dORB-1).

The project is deployed on Render. You can access the deployed site [here](https://hospital-portal.onrender.com).

## Technologies Used
